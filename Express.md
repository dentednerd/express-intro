# Express
Mongoose is a bridge between JS and MongoDB  
wraps around it and makes it easier  
Express does the same thing for servers  
allows us to build server applications for the web  
```javascript
const server = express();
```
IT'S THAT EASY WTF  
use Nodemon for servers; Nodemon refreshes the server each time you make a change  
`res.end` sends data, `res.send` sends HTML  

middleware sits between client and server
